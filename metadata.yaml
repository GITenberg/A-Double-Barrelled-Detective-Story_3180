description: "A Double Barreled Detective Story is a short story/novelette by Mark\
  \ Twain (Samuel Clemens), in which Sherlock Holmes finds himself in the American\
  \ west.\nThe story contains two arcs of revenges. In the primary arc, a woman was\
  \ abused, humiliated and abandoned by her fiancé Jacob Fuller, while she bore his\
  \ child. The child was born and named Archy Stillman and when he got older, the\
  \ mother discovered that the child possessed an incredible ability of smell, like\
  \ a bloodhound. The mother instructed her child, now sixteen, to seek out his biological\
  \ father, destroy that man’s peace and reputation, hence extract satisfaction for\
  \ her.\nFive years later in a second arc, at a mining camp in California, Fetlock\
  \ Jones, a nephew of Sherlock Holmes, killed his master Flint Buckner, a silver-miner,\
  \ by blowing up his cabin. Since this occurs when Holmes happened to be visiting,\
  \ Holmes applied his skills to bear upon the case and derived a logically worked\
  \ conclusion that was proved to be abysmally wrong by Archy Stillman using his sense\
  \ of smell. This could be seen as yet another piece where Twain tried to prove that\
  \ life does not quite follow logic.\nThis is a satire by Twain on the mystery novel\
  \ genre. In the second arc, Sherlock Holmes was depicted in employing \"scientific\
  \ methods\" to a ridiculous degree, yet arriving at a completely wrong assessment.\
  \ On the other hand, the crime was solved with a supernatural ability that no normal\
  \ human possesses. Yet even that could fail to reveal the whole truth as the final\
  \ twist of the story indicated.\nFurthermore, Sam Clemens/Mark Twain poked through\
  \ the \"4th wall\" and appeared as himself in the middle of the story, supposedly\
  \ while the story was being serialized, and responded to letters sent in by readers\
  \ to the newspaper editor. During the exchange, Twain made fun of/self-advertised\
  \ on some of his other famous short stories.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
